# PROJECT MEMORY

## Overview
SanctumCap website transformation project focusing on creating a premium, interactive experience with sophisticated animations and scroll-triggered narrative elements.

## Completed Tasks

### [2024-12-19] Task Completed: Hero Section Transformation & Global Vertical Text System
- **Outcome**: Successfully implemented immediate marquee activation, fixed vertical text layout, and created a global contextual vertical text system
- **Breakthrough**: Created a sophisticated scroll-triggered narrative system that changes content based on current section, providing continuous interactive storytelling across the entire website
- **Errors Fixed**: 
  - Removed marquee delay (changed from 90s duration with delay to 60s with no delay)
  - Fixed vertical text elements that were stacked instead of horizontal with circle separators
  - Resolved text size issues by increasing from text-xl to text-2xl lg:text-3xl
- **Code Changes**: 
  - Created `GlobalVerticalText.tsx` component with section-aware content mapping
  - Updated `HeroSection.tsx` to remove local vertical text and marquee delays
  - Modified `Index.tsx` to include global vertical text component
  - Added `GDPGrowthChart.tsx` section ID for proper detection
  - Enhanced `index.css` with fadeIn animations and vertical writing mode utilities
- **Next Dependencies**: This enables the interactive scroll narrative flow that adapts content contextually as users navigate through different sections

## Key Breakthroughs

### Interactive Scroll Narrative System
- Implemented a global vertical text system that persists across all sections
- Content dynamically changes based on scroll position and current section
- Each section has contextually relevant finance/real estate adjectives
- Smooth animations with staggered fadeIn effects for premium feel

### Section-Aware Content Mapping
- Hero: EXCLUSIVE, STRATEGIC, LUCRATIVE, DIVERSIFIED | PREMIUM, PROFITABLE, SECURE, ELITE
- Metrics: PERFORMANCE, GROWTH, RETURNS, SUCCESS | PROVEN, RELIABLE, CONSISTENT, EXCEPTIONAL
- Journey: EXPERIENCE, EXPERTISE, INNOVATION, LEADERSHIP | TRUSTED, ESTABLISHED, VISIONARY, PIONEERING
- Partners: GLOBAL, NETWORK, ALLIANCE, COLLABORATION | INTERNATIONAL, CONNECTED, UNIFIED, PARTNERSHIP
- Growth: EXPANSION, DEVELOPMENT, PROGRESS, ADVANCEMENT | SCALING, EVOLVING, RISING, FLOURISHING
- Developers: CONSTRUCTION, ARCHITECTURE, DESIGN, BUILDING | QUALITY, CRAFTSMANSHIP, EXCELLENCE, PRECISION
- Contact: CONNECT, ENGAGE, COMMUNICATE, REACH | ACCESSIBLE, RESPONSIVE, AVAILABLE, SUPPORTIVE

## Error Patterns & Solutions

### Marquee Delay Issues
- **Problem**: Mouse interaction delays and marquee not starting immediately
- **Solution**: Removed all delays from GSAP animations, set delay: 0 explicitly

### Vertical Text Layout Problems
- **Problem**: Text elements stacked vertically instead of horizontal with separators
- **Solution**: Implemented proper flex layout with circle separators between text items

### Section Detection Challenges
- **Problem**: Mismatched section IDs between components and detection system
- **Solution**: Audited all section IDs and created accurate mapping system

## Architecture Decisions

### Global vs Local Component Strategy
- Chose global vertical text component over section-specific implementations
- Enables consistent behavior and easier maintenance
- Provides seamless user experience across page transitions

### GSAP ScrollTrigger Integration
- Used ScrollTrigger for both section detection and scroll-based animations
- Implemented proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Optimized performance with efficient scroll handling

### CSS Animation Strategy
- Combined GSAP for complex scroll animations with CSS for simple transitions
- Added custom fadeIn animations for smooth content transitions
- Implemented vertical writing mode utilities for consistent text orientation
