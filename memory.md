- Contact: CONNECT, ENGAGE, COMMUNICATE, REACH | ACCESSIBLE, RESPONSIVE, AVAILABLE, SUPPORTIVE

## Error Patterns & Solutions

### Marquee Delay Issues
- **Problem**: Mouse interaction delays and marquee not starting immediately
- **Solution**: Removed all delays from GSAP animations, set delay: 0 explicitly

### Vertical Text Layout Problems
- **Problem**: Text elements stacked vertically instead of horizontal with separators
- **Solution**: Implemented proper flex layout with circle separators between text items

### Section Detection Challenges
- **Problem**: Mismatched section IDs between components and detection system
- **Solution**: Audited all section IDs and created accurate mapping system

## Architecture Decisions

### Global vs Local Component Strategy
- Chose global vertical text component over section-specific implementations
- Enables consistent behavior and easier maintenance
- Provides seamless user experience across page transitions

### GSAP ScrollTrigger Integration
- Used ScrollTrigger for both section detection and scroll-based animations
- Implemented proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Optimized performance with efficient scroll handling

### CSS Animation Strategy
- Combined GSAP for complex scroll animations with CSS for simple transitions
- Added custom fadeIn animations for smooth content transitions
- Implemented vertical writing mode utilities for consistent text orientation
