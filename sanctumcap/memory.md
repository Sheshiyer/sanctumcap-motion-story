### [2024-12-19] Task Completed: Created Performance Optimization Checklist
- **Outcome**: Comprehensive performance-optimization.md with Core Web Vitals targets and optimization strategies
- **Breakthrough**: Defined specific metrics (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1) and component-level optimizations
- **Code Changes**: Created performance-optimization.md with animation performance, image optimization, bundle optimization, and monitoring strategies
- **Next Dependencies**: Enables high-performance implementation and measurable success criteria

### [2024-12-19] Task Completed: Created Prompt Scaffolding for Website Generation
- **Outcome**: Complete prompt-scaffolding.md that leverages PRD, component types, and website copy for full website generation
- **Breakthrough**: Integrated all project documentation into actionable generation instructions with professional iconography and contextual assets
- **Code Changes**: Created prompt-scaffolding.md with section-by-section generation guidelines, asset requirements, and quality standards
- **Next Dependencies**: Enables automated generation of production-ready website sections with brand consistency

## Key Breakthroughs
- **Brand Alignment**: Successfully translated SanctumCap Brand Guidelines into a comprehensive digital color system
- **Accessibility Focus**: All color combinations maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios
- **Scalability**: Created color scales (50-900) for each brand color enabling flexible theming
- **Component Integration**: Defined specific color usage for navigation, cards, buttons, forms, and interactive elements

## Architecture Decisions
